# BTE


Calculates the thermal conductivity of superlattices using the Boltzmann Transport Equation as introduced in the paper by Hua et al.  (J. Appl. Phys. 117, 175306 (2015)) and elaborated on in the paper by Ye et al. (Submitted to PRB Jul 2018).

Can account for modal reflection/transmission and partial specularity.  Requires input material data such as that obtained by DFT.  The sample DFT data here was provided by Lucas Lindsay.

Does not include wave/coherent effects.
